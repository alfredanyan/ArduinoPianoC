Building a proximity sensor using an Ultrasonic Sensor module accurate between 2 - 400 cm
A pulse will be sent to the trigger pin for 10 micro seconds
This then sends an 8-cycle burst frequency out of a speaker which gets received by an echo receiver that measures the distance by how quickly the signal bounces back
Changes in a current interacting with a magnet cause a diaphragm to vibrate creating a sound wave frequency.
When the sound waves bounce back, this is going to be converted into a current
